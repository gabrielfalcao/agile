# Agile

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabrielfalcao/agile.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gabrielfalcao/agile)

Meta-package for python with tools for an agile development workflow.

Recommended by [Gabriel FalcÃ£o](http://j.mp/gabrielfalcao), creator of [HTTPretty](http://j.mp/Httpretty), [steadymark](http://j.mp/steadymark), [sure](http://j.mp/py-sure) and [lettuce](http://github.com/py-lettuce).


## add it to your project


```bash
pip install agile
```

## what is in it?

#### mock

The [mock](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/) library is the
easiest and most expressive way to mock in python.

###### example: mocking I/O calls:

```python
# cool-git-project/my_cool_library/core.py
import io
import json


class JSONDatabase(object):
    def __init__(self, filename=None, data={}):
        self.filename = filename
        self.data = data

    def state_to_json(self):
        return json.dumps(self.data)

    def save(self):
        # open file
        fd = io.open(self.filename, 'wb')
        fd.write(self.state_to_json())
        fd.close()
```


```python
# cool-git-project/tests/unit/test_core.py
from mock import patch
from my_cool_library.core import JSONDatabase


@patch('my_cool_library.core.io')
@patch('my_cool_library.core.JSONDatabase.state_to_json')
def test_json_database_save(state_to_json, io):
    ("JSONDatabase.save() should open the database file, "
     "and write the latest json state of the data")

    # Given that the call to io.open returns a mock
    mocked_fd = io.open.return_value

    # And that I create an instance of JSONDatabase with some data
    jdb = JSONDatabase('my-database.json', data={'foo': 'bar'})

    # When I call .save()
    jdb.save()

    # Then the file descriptor should have been opened in write mode,
    # and pointing to the right file
    io.open.assert_called_once_with('my-database.json', 'w')

    # And the returned file descriptor should have been used
    # to write the return value from state_to_json
    mocked_fd.write.assert_called_once_with(state_to_json.return_value)

    # And then the file descriptor should have been closed
    mocked_fd.close.assert_called_once_with()
```


pretty great, huh?

#### sure

Sure modifies the all the python objects in memory, adding a special
property `should`, that allows you to test aspects of the given
object.

Let's see it in practice.

Still considering the project from the *mock* example above, now let's
test that `state_to_json` returns a json string.

```python
def test_json_database_state_to_json():
    ("JSONDatabase.state_to_json() should return a valid json string")
    # Given that I have an instance of the database containing some data
    jdb = JSONDatabase(data={'name': 'Foo Bar'})

    # When I call .state_to_json
    result = jdb.state_to_json()

    # Then it should return a valid JSON
    result.should.equal('{"name": "Foo Bar"}')
```


#### nose + coverage + rednose

```bash
nosetests -vsx --rednose --with-coverage --cover-package=my_cool_library tests/unit
# or
nosetests -vsx --rednose --with-coverage --cover-package=my_cool_library tests/functional
```

Nose is a great test runner, recursively scans for files that start with `test_` and and with `.py`.
It supports plugins and agile installs two cool plugins:

###### coverage
coverage is a module that collects test coverage data so that nose can
show a summary of what lines of python code don't have test coverage.

###### rednose
Rednose is a plugin that prints a prettier output when running the tests, and show bad things in **red** which highlights problems and make it easier to see where is the problem, pretty awesome.

More over, **as long as you write single-line docstrings to describe
your tests** rednose will show the whole sentence, pretty and with no
chops.


```bash
JSONDatabase.save() should open the database file, and write the latest json state of the data ... passed
JSONDatabase.state_to_json() should return a valid json string ... passed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 tests run in 0.0 seconds (2 tests passed)
```

ps.: nose actually matches files that contain `test` in the name and can also find `TestCase` classes, but I recommend using function-based tests, for clarity, expressiveness and to enforce simplicity. We developers tend to add too much logic to setup and teardown functions when writing test-based class.


## Gists:


#### creating a basic python test infrastructure

```bash
mkdir -p tests/{unit,functional}
touch tests/{unit,functional,}/__init__.py
printf 'import sure\nsure\n' > tests/unit/__init__.py
printf 'import sure\nsure\n' > tests/functional/__init__.py
```

now go ahead and add a unit test file, try to name your test file such that it resembles module being tested,
for example, let's say you are testing `my_cool_library/engine.py`, you could create a test file like this

```bash
printf "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n" > tests/unit/test_engine.py
```
